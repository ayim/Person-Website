                Between menu hell and copius amounts of scrolling, the fundamental usability of UWaterloo food services'
                website is challenged. Key information about opening hours and dietary values are not provided in a way
                that meets busy students' needs.

                With food being a physical requirement for human survival, students
                prefer to visit off campus food outlets. Thus, our high
                level goals were to help UW Food Services achieve the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Give users the certainty of arriving at an open on-campus food outlet</li>
                <li>Make it fast and easy to find a meal that suits users' dietary & culinary preferences</li>
                <li>Gather user feedback to help improve product offerings</li>
