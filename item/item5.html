                            <p>
                                At my Cadet Corps, I had participated in an earlier attempt to form a massed band with
                                another unit. After that effort had collapsed, I worked towards my drum major qualification
                                while volunteering to help start a found a band that belonged to the cadet unit.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As we lacked percussionists,
                                our monthly performances were tough. Morale was low, and it was clear to both the band, and the cadet
                                unit that our new team needed traction.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                With the help of other senior cadets, we created branding assets to help us in our
                                active promotion of the benefits of joining our new band. Combined with speakers from other
                                successful military bands in the local area, member enrollment increased significantly.
                            </p>

                                The strongest musicians within the new membership were given further training, and roles
                                as section leaders to provide other members mentorship. With their hard work and the grit
                                of our members, our tunes became more musical. With everyone's help, we dared to
                                take crazy ideas and put them together in a marching sequence for our very first Band
                                Competition. There, as the only Army Cadets on parade, we brought home a Silver standing.

                                Today, our success is reflected in the interest shown towards the music program. In addition to their regular training on
                                Tuesday nights, the cadets dedicate another 3 hours per week to band practices. As pioneers
                                within the cadet unit, the 3 extremely qualified replacements
                                who I mentor twice a week and numerous cadets that regularly attend summer music camp are proof

                                    My high school, Steveston-London Secondary has traditionally had a very strong performing culture. The year before
                                    I became an executive, the sole member with media experience had graduated, and as such, large events
                                    that required A/V support simply weren't possible.

                                    By combining audio-visual training taken during elementary school and project management experience from Cadets, I
                                    founded an event support crew that coordinates logistics, audio visual support, and handles communication with
                                    performers in order to help events run smoothly. The team serves 30+ events per year.

                                    Although the role of tech crew is gritty at times, I enjoy watching performances unfold with my help.
                                    By establishing a training and execution framework for coordinating audio visual support,
                                    what was originally a solo operation has since expanded to a group of twelve.
